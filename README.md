# Consulate Correspondence Project

A working repository for my consulate correspondence network project. For now, the repository holds notes about data wrangling and other project decisions.

## Project Goal

This project hopes to visualize Mexican consulate correspondence networks in the United States. The first dataset is built with correspondence logs from the Kansas City, Missouri consulate in 1932.

## Updates

Check back for project updates, including a useable dataset.
